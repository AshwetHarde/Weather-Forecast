# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# SkyShow - Weather Forecast Web Application

SkyShow is a user-friendly weather application that provides real-time weather updates based on user location. The app offers a clear and attractive interface, displaying current weather conditions, hourly forecasts, and daily summaries.

## Features
#### Current Weather: Displays temperature, weather conditions, and wind speed.
#### Hourly Forecast: Shows detailed weather predictions for the next 24 hours.
#### Daily Forecast: Provides a summary of the upcoming week's weather.
#### User Location: Automatically detects and displays weather based on user location or allows manual search.
#### Responsive Design: Optimized for both mobile and desktop devices.

## Technologies Used

### React
### Open Meteo API (or your chosen weather API)
### CSS for styling
### React Icons for user interface enhancements

## Accuracy of Weather Data
While the weather application provides real-time weather updates based on user location and input, it is important to note that the accuracy of the weather data is not guaranteed. The app relies on third-party weather APIs to retrieve information, and factors such as data source reliability, environmental conditions, and variations in local weather patterns can affect the precision of the forecasts. Users are encouraged to use the app as a helpful guide for weather information but should also consider consulting official meteorological services for critical decisions related to weather conditions.
